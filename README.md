# JonsVanities
A Terraria mod adding vanity items my friend Jon would like in the game.

Currently only adds Fish Flops, which can be fished from the ocean. They're the only junk item you'll catch there, so look out for the gray text!

If you have any content suggestions or bug reports, please don't hesitate to put them in the issue tracker here on GitHub! Thanks.
